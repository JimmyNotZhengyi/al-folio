Hi! I'm **Zhengyi Guo (Jimmy)**, a Master of Financial Engineering student at Columbia University.  
I'm passionate about **quantitative finance**, especially in **derivatives trading**, **machine learning**, and **portfolio optimization**.

Previously, I worked on:
- Improving liquidity forecasting models for A-shares (reduced prediction error by 30%)
- Applying Monte Carlo simulation for VaR estimation in multi-asset portfolios
- Researching deep learning applications in financial time series

I believe financial engineering is a bridge between rigorous mathematical modeling and impactful investment decisions. Always excited to collaborate on quant research or trading ideas!

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/JimmyNotZhengyi) or drop me a message.
