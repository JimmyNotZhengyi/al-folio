I am Zhengyi Guo, a Master of Financial Engineering student at Columbia University.  
Before coming to Columbia, I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics from University of Liverpool.  
My academic interest is mainly on modern machine learning from probability perspective.  
Currently, I’m passionate about **Quantitative Finance**, **Generative AI**, and **Decentralized Finance**.

Apart from research, I love working out, football, basketball, poker and travelling.  
Moreover, I plan to try vlog creation and learn to ski. If you have similar hobbies, feel free to reach out!
